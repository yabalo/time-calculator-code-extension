# Time Calculator

Do simple calculations with time (and scalar) values. 

## Features

Run `TimeCalc: Calculate time` to interpret the current line or selection and append the result.

For example:

`8:27 + 8:00`

becomes 

`8:27 + 8:00 = 16:27`

If you run `TimeCalc: Calculate time` on this expression, an information message is shown with the text 'Correct!'. 

Supported operators:

 - plus (`+`), minus (`-`), product (`*`) and division (`/`) with operator precedence (multiply and divide over sum and substract)
 - parentheses ('`(`' and '`)`') to group expressions
 - equals (`=`) to check if the left hand side is equal to the right hand side

## Known Issues
